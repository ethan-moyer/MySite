## Description
This project is a small game prototype/demo for a four-person local-multiplayer FPS primarily inspired by *Halo*. The project was created over a time frame of roughly five months and a half months (April 2021 - September 2021). I chose to do this project as a learning exercise, specifically so that I could learn more about programming games for multiplayer (handling inputs, splitscreen, multiplayer audio, etc.) and to get more practice with component systems.

I built the project using the Unity game engine and scripts were written in C#. All the models were made using Blender.
